# fundfair
A fund that raises money for a fund with raffle tickets


# lean


* Token distribtion for rolling ticket, but adds complexity
* L2 would make this much more gas savy, but adds complexity and limits user to the L2 chosen?


# tokennomics idea

* Make two pools, 20/80 and 80/20. For the 20/80 pool give out 1 vote token, for the 80/20 pool give out 4 token per ticket.
